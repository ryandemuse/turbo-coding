Turbo Coding Simulation Package
    DATE: 13 MARCH 2017
    AUTHOR: RYAN T. DEMUSE
    
This package is intended to be used as a simulation of turbo encoding and decoding 
over a channel with Additive White Gaussian Noise. It contains several encoder and
decoder architectures in encoder/decoder.c encoders3/decoders3.c and
encoder4/decoder4.c. The channel characterization is included in the files of the
same name. The debug file includes debugging functions as well as some helpful
utilities. A Makefile is also included. The Makefile is structured so that all of 
the files have to be in the same folder in order to compile into an executable.

DISCLAIMER: This code has not yet been extensively tested and edited. I do not
    claim that it will work 100% as intended. I have already encountered some
    flaws and errors that will be fixed as soon as I have time to tend to them.
    I am providing this code as a helpful tool as I have yet to find a turbo coding
    simulation package that includes several encoder/decoder architectures and
    carefully considers the construction of interleavers.
